This program uses concurrent processes (semaphores) to solve Conway's problem:

Write a program to read 80-column cards and write them as 125-character lines with 
the following changes. After every card image the string <EOL>  is inserted. Every adjacent pair of 
asterisks  ** is replaced by a #. 
  
An example column card is provided as conway.txt
