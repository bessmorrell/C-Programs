This program finds the exponantial model and logistic model for a population data matrix, and returns which model better fits the data.

Example output:

>> Population_Model_Optimization
sum(abs(Data-Exponential)) =
   5.8955e+05

sum(abs(Data-Logistic)) =
   2.1739e+05

Logistic model is better fit
